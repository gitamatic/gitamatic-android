# Gitamatic – User Guide

---

## 1. What is Gitamatic?

**Gitamatic** is a mobile application designed for guitarists, music enthusiasts, and anyone looking to easily create and edit their compositions directly on their phone. 

Unlike traditional tablature editors, Gitamatic introduces an alternative approach to displaying and organizing notes — inspired by the interfaces of desktop digital audio workstations (DAWs).

The app combines at least two types of notation editors, offering an intuitive interface that allows users to quickly and easily compose and edit guitar parts.

### Key Features:
- Customizable falling-note visualization
- Adjustable colors, sizes, and effects
- Optimized for both personal use and sharing compositions on social media

Currently, Gitamatic is focused primarily on acoustic guitar tools. However, future updates will include support for more instruments such as:
- Bass guitar
- Drums
- Ukulele
- Piano
- And more

Our mission is not only to introduce new features, but also to develop innovative solutions. We prioritize user feedback and focus on delivering tools and functionality that matter most to our community.

*Stay tuned for more updates and improvements based on your needs!*

## 2. What is Guitar Tablature?

**Guitar tablature** (or simply *tab*) is a simplified form of musical notation used primarily for string instruments, especially the guitar. 

Unlike traditional sheet music, tablature doesn't require knowledge of music theory or the ability to read standard notation, which makes it especially popular among beginners and self-taught guitarists.

### How does tablature work?

Tablature is a text-based system that indicates which strings to play and which frets to press in order to produce a melody or chord. 

Unlike classical notation, it visually represents finger positions on the fretboard, making it much easier to understand and follow.

Here's an example of a simple guitar tab:

Each line represents a guitar string (from high *e* at the top to low *E* at the bottom). The numbers indicate which fret to press on the corresponding string.

For example:
- On the **D** string (4th from the bottom), play the **2nd fret**
- On the **G** string (3rd from the bottom), play **2nd fret**
- On the **B** string (2nd from the bottom), play **1st fret**

This kind of notation allows you to quickly understand finger placement without needing to read notes.

## 3. Advantages and Limitations of Tablature

### ✅ Advantages of Tablature

- **Easy to understand** – You don't need to know about sharps, flats, or note durations to start playing music from tabs.
- **Highly applicable** – Works for both simple rhythm patterns and complex solos.
- **Versatile** – Used in all music genres: classical, jazz, rock, and more.
- **Creative tool** – A convenient way to capture and develop your own musical ideas.

### ⚠️ What Tablature Shows — and What It Doesn’t

Tablature tells you **where to place your fingers** on the fretboard, but it **does not** show:

- Note duration (how long to hold a note)
- Rhythm or timing
- Dynamics (how loud or soft to play)
- Technique details (legato, slides, bends, etc. — sometimes noted, but not always clearly)

Because of these limitations, tabs are often used alongside **audio or video recordings**, helping guitarists understand how a piece is meant to sound.

---

## 4. Types of Tablature

- **Melody (Solo) Tabs**  
  Display each note individually, string by string.

- **Chord Tabs**  
  Include chord names above the tablature to indicate harmonic structure.

- **Lyrics with Chords**  
  Combine song lyrics and chord symbols to show when to change chords as you sing.

---

## 5. Why Is Tablature Important?

For most guitarists, tablature is the **first step** to learning the instrument. It allows you to:

- Quickly start playing your favorite songs  
- Train your fingers and memorize fretboard positions  
- Create and share your own parts  
- Store musical ideas in a simple, readable format

---

## 6. How Tablature Works in Gitamatic

In Gitamatic, tablature is not just plain text — it’s an **interactive, multimedia tool**, fully integrated into the app’s visual and functional design.

### 🔍 Key Interactive Features:

- **Fretboard Visualization**  
  When you open a tab, Gitamatic displays real-time fretboard positions, showing exactly where to place your fingers.

- **Note Animation**  
  Each note is animated as it plays, helping you follow the correct sequence and finger movements.

- **Audio + Video Playback**  
  Tabs include synchronized sound and optional playback, so you don’t just read — you also hear and feel the rhythm.

---

### 🎸 Tablature as a Bridge Between Text and Sound

While tablature is essentially text-based, Gitamatic turns it into a powerful experience thanks to:

- 🎨 **Visuals** – Interactive guitar neck with live finger positions  
- 🔊 **Sound** – Real-time playback linked with each note  
- 🎞️ **Motion** – Animated finger movements following the music

---

> In Gitamatic, tablature isn’t just a way to write down music — it’s a digital language that connects the guitarist with their instrument through sight, sound, and motion.

Dynamics define the **intensity** of a note.  
Standard notation symbols include:

- `ppp` – very, very soft  
- `pp` – very soft  
- `p` – soft  
- `mp` – moderately soft  
- `mf` – moderately loud  
- `f` – loud  
- `ff` – very loud  
- `fff` – extremely loud  
![Dynamics Selector](img17)

---

#### 9.3.1.2 Duration

Musical note durations (fractions):

- Whole note (1)  
- Half note (1/2)  
- Quarter note (1/4)  
- Eighth note (1/8)  
- Sixteenth (1/16)  
- Thirty-second (1/32)  
- Sixty-fourth (1/64)

The smaller the fraction, the shorter and faster the note.  
Example: note set to **1/8 duration**  
![Note Duration in Grid](img17)

---

### 9.3.2 Rhythm Settings

To configure rhythm:

1. Tap the **Rhythm Settings button**  
2. A configuration window appears  
![Rhythm Settings Button](img17)  
![Rhythm Settings Dialog](img17)


## 10. Tempo and Ticks Configuration

### 10.1 Base Configuration (Index 0)

The **first configuration** cannot be deleted — it represents the **starting point** of the composition.  
However, both **Tempo** (BPM) and **Ticks Per Beat** (TPB) can be edited.  
- The **Index** is always `0` and defines the beginning of the composition.

#### How it works:
- **Tempo** (BPM) defines how fast the beats are played in real time.
- **TPB** (Ticks Per Beat) defines how many precise subdivisions each beat has.

**Example:**
At `120 BPM` and `480 TPB`:
- A quarter note lasts **500 ms**
- 1 tick ≈ **1.041 ms**  
This allows for high-resolution note placement and playback precision.

---

### 10.2 Add New Tempo/Ticks Configuration

Tap the **plus button** to create a new configuration block:  
![Add Config](img1)

**Fields to enter:**
- **Tick Index** – the tick where the new configuration begins
- **Tempo (BPM)** – speed of the beat
- **TPB** – ticks per beat

**Example:** If `Index = 50`, `Tempo = 120`, `TPB = 16`, the new configuration applies starting at tick 50, until another configuration replaces it — or indefinitely.  
![New Config Result](img1)

---

### 10.3 Delete Tempo/Ticks Configuration

To remove a configuration:
1. Tap the **minus button** on the left side of the config row  
2. Tap **Save** to confirm  
![Delete Config](img1)

---

## 11. Layout Mode ↔ Grid Mode Sync

Both **Layout Mode** and **Grid Mode** display the **same notes**, just in different visual formats.

### Key Sync Behaviors:

1. **Notes added in Grid Mode** appear in **exact alignment** with the timeline bar in Layout Mode.  
2. **Notes added in Layout Mode** align visually with the timeline, but in Grid Mode their tick position is approximated to the **nearest index value**, based on internal time calculation.

---

## 12. Custom Design – Layout Mode Only

To personalize how your compositions are displayed during playback, Gitamatic includes a **Design System**.

Accessible from:  
**Top Menu → Layout Design**

If no custom designs exist, only the default **Gitamatic (Built-in)** design will appear.  
> This default design is read-only and serves as a base template for creating new ones.

---

### 12.1 Creating a New Design

1. Tap the **plus button** to add a new layout design  
2. A new window opens with multiple customization parameters  
3. Scroll to view all options (not all settings fit on one screen)
